**darkcourses** 

color scheme for urxvt / xterm, mc, ncmpcpp, ls (via dircolors), (g)Vim, vifm, mutt and dwm. It aims to be a little theme for terminal based applications.

Additionaly, you'll find here a bunch of my config files, as well as my customized dwm-sprinkles setup (additionaly patched with moveresize, borderless monocle layout and the proper full screen mode).
