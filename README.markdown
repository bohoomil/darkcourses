**darkcourses** 

color scheme for urxvt / xterm, mc, ncmpcpp, ls (via dircolors), (g)Vim and vifm. It aims to be a little theme for terminal based applications.

Additionaly, you'll find here a bunch of my config files, as well as my customized dwm-sprinkles configs (additionaly patched with moveresize, borderless monocle and proper full screen mode).
