===========

Colour scheme for urxvt / xterm, mc, ncmpcpp, ls (via dircolors), Vim, vifm, mutt, evilwm and dwm. It aims to be a little theme for terminal based applications.

Additionaly, you'll find here a bunch of my config files, as well as my customized dwm-sprinkles setup (additionaly patched with moveresize, borderless monocle layout, the proper full screen mode, and probably a few bits of code I can't recall at the moment).
